# Phase 04: Publish and README Badge Integration Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Publish privacy-safe aggregate badge JSON and connect it to a stable README badge URL.
**Verified:** 2026-03-30T16:43:20Z
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Init can create a public gist automatically when auth exists and can connect or defer cleanly when it does not. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/core/src/publish/publish-target.ts:103` enforces explicit-id -> configured-id -> create -> defer ordering, and `packages/agent-badge/src/commands/init.ts:401` persists and reports the outcome. `packages/agent-badge/src/commands/init.test.ts:249`, `:308`, `:371`, and `:553` cover connect, create, reuse, and defer paths. |
| 2 | Publish writes aggregate-only Shields endpoint JSON with the expected badge fields. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/core/src/publish/badge-payload.ts:39` returns only `schemaVersion`, `label`, `message`, and `color`; `packages/core/src/publish/publish-service.ts:68` derives totals from scan+attribution and updates only `agent-badge.json`. `packages/core/src/publish/publish-service.test.ts:162` asserts the payload excludes session ids, local paths, and reason strings. |
| 3 | The README receives one stable badge URL or a pasteable snippet when no README exists. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/core/src/publish/badge-url.ts:11` derives the stable endpoint URL from gist identity plus `agent-badge.json`. `packages/agent-badge/src/commands/init.ts:456` publishes before `writeReadmeBadgeOutput()`, and `packages/core/src/publish/readme-badge.ts:23` builds the managed README/snippet markup. `packages/agent-badge/src/commands/init.test.ts:281` and `:461` cover README insertion and snippet output. |
| 4 | Re-running init or publish does not duplicate README badge entries. | ✓ VERIFIED | `packages/core/src/publish/publish-target.ts:119` reuses configured gist ids, `packages/core/src/publish/readme-badge.ts:36` replaces any existing managed badge block, and `packages/agent-badge/src/commands/publish.ts:124` only rewrites state, not README content. `packages/agent-badge/src/commands/init.test.ts:371` and `:500` verify gist reuse and single-block README idempotency. |

**Score:** 4/4 truths verified

| `packages/core/src/publish/readme-badge.ts` | Managed README badge insertion/snippet helpers | ✓ VERIFIED | Marker-bounded upsert keeps a single managed block and supports no-README snippet output. |
| `packages/agent-badge/src/commands/init.ts` | End-to-end init wiring | ✓ VERIFIED | Establishes target, performs first publish, then updates README or prints a snippet. |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PUBL-01` | `04-01-PLAN.md` | Init can create a public Gist automatically when GitHub auth is available. | ✓ SATISFIED | `publish-target.ts:123` creates a public gist; `init.test.ts:308` verifies automatic creation with auth. |
| `PUBL-02` | `04-01-PLAN.md` | If automatic Gist creation fails, developer can retry, connect an existing Gist, or continue in explicit unpublished mode. | ✓ SATISFIED | `publish-target.ts:109`/`:135` defer cleanly; `init.ts:428` prints actionable deferred guidance; `init.test.ts:249`, `:371`, and `:553` cover connect/reuse/defer paths. |
| `PUBL-03` | `04-02-PLAN.md` | `publish` writes aggregate-only Shields endpoint JSON with `schemaVersion`, `label`, `message`, `color`, and cache behavior fields. | ✓ SATISFIED | `badge-payload.ts:39`, `badge-url.ts:3`, and `publish-service.test.ts:162` verify the payload shape, stable endpoint, and aggregate-only content. |
| `BOOT-05` | `04-03-PLAN.md` | Init inserts one stable badge URL into the repository README or prints a pasteable snippet when no README exists. | ✓ SATISFIED | `init.ts:456` -> `writeReadmeBadgeOutput()` and `init.test.ts:461` cover README and snippet behavior. |
| `PUBL-04` | `04-03-PLAN.md` | The README badge URL stays stable after init; later updates modify only the remote JSON. | ✓ SATISFIED | `badge-url.ts:11` derives a stable URL; `readme-badge.ts:36` keeps one managed block; `publish.ts:124` updates state only; `init.test.ts:500` verifies no duplication on rerun. |

Phase 4 plan requirements match the Phase 4 traceability entries in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`; no orphaned Phase 4 requirements were found.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | - | No TODO/FIXME/placeholder stub patterns in the Phase 4 implementation files | - | No blocker or warning-level anti-patterns found. |

### Human Verification Required

### 1. Live GitHub + Shields publish smoke test

**Test:** In a throwaway repository with a real `GH_TOKEN`, run `agent-badge init`, inspect the created or connected public gist, then run `agent-badge publish` again.
**Expected:** The public gist contains `agent-badge.json`; the stored badge URL renders through Shields; README contains exactly one managed badge block or init prints exactly one snippet if no README exists; the second publish keeps the same badge URL and README block.
**Why human:** This depends on live GitHub auth, real public Gist writes, and the external Shields rendering path.

### Gaps Summary

No code or test gaps were found in Phase 4. The remaining work is one live external smoke check against GitHub + Shields, so automated verification is complete but final sign-off still needs human confirmation.
