# agent-badge

## What This Is

`agent-badge` is a local-first, serverless CLI that lets a repository publish a stable GitHub README badge showing historical and ongoing AI-agent usage. It initializes a repo, scans local Codex and Claude data under `~/.codex` and `~/.claude`, attributes that usage to the current repo, publishes aggregate badge JSON to a public Gist, and renders the badge through a fixed Shields endpoint URL.

The product is for developers who want a low-friction, trustworthy way to show how much AI assistance a repository has consumed without running a backend or exposing raw transcripts.

## Core Value

Any repository can display an accurate, privacy-preserving AI usage badge with one setup command and near-zero ongoing maintenance.

## Current Milestone: v1.1 Production Hardening and Ship Readiness

**Goal:** Turn the implemented v1 feature set into a release candidate that can be built, tested, packaged, and shipped from current source with no red gates.

**Target features:**
- Restore green source-of-truth verification for build, tests, and critical release checks.
- Close release blockers in doctor/schema compatibility, Claude incremental refresh coverage, and Octokit typing/build integration.
- Publish deliberate package metadata and clean tarballs for `@agent-badge/core`, `agent-badge`, and `create-agent-badge`.
- Prove the packed-install and release flow under the repo's known npm-cache and disk-space constraints.

## Requirements

### Validated

- [x] Historical Codex and Claude usage can be backfilled, attributed conservatively, and reviewed through `agent-badge scan` without creating a second primary ledger. Validated in Phase 3.
- [x] Ambiguous historical sessions stay out of totals until explicitly included or excluded, and those override decisions are reused on later scans. Validated in Phase 3.
- [x] One-command initialization configures an existing or new repo end to end, including local runtime install, repo fingerprinting, badge publishing, README setup, and refresh integration. Validated in Phase 4.
- [x] The published badge stays stable in `README.md` while the underlying aggregate JSON is refreshed through public Gist updates. Validated in Phase 4.
- [x] Future Codex and Claude usage can be refreshed incrementally from local machine data without full historical rescans or a second primary ledger. Validated in Phase 5.
- [x] Refresh is fast and failure-soft by default so normal `git push` workflows stay unblocked. Validated in Phase 5.
- [x] Developers can inspect attribution, publishing, and hook health through clear `status`, `doctor`, `config`, and `uninstall` flows. Validated across Phases 5-7, with release hardening continuing in v1.1.
- [x] Maintainers can run `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run docs:check`, and clean-checkout package smoke verification successfully from current source on a supported Node toolchain. Validated in Phase 8.

### Active

- [ ] Published workspace packages use deliberate release versions, correct internal dependency references, and ship only runtime artifacts needed for install and execution.
- [ ] Release packaging uses deliberate workspace versions, correct internal dependency references, and clean tarball contents instead of placeholder metadata.
- [ ] The end-to-end release checklist covers constrained-environment publish steps such as isolated npm cache usage, disk-space workarounds, and package-name verification.

### Out of Scope

- Hosted backend collection or server-managed badge rendering - v1 must stay local-first and serverless.
- Uploading raw transcripts, prompt content, filenames, or local absolute paths - publishing must expose aggregates only.
- Multi-maintainer shared badge state and team dashboards - valuable later, but not required for a credible single-repo v1.
- GitHub Actions-based collection from `~/.codex` or `~/.claude` - repository CI cannot access the local-first data sources reliably.

## Context

Phases 1 through 7 established the monorepo, shared schemas, init preflight, idempotent `.agent-badge` scaffolding, repo fingerprinting, provider parsing, historical backfill, conservative attribution, deterministic public Gist publishing, stable README badge insertion, incremental refresh flows, operator commands, and release-oriented docs/tests.

As of 2026-03-31 after Phase 8, the source-of-truth release gates are green again: the Octokit build seam is compile-safe, doctor and Claude incremental tests match the live schema/runtime behavior, and one clean-checkout verifier now proves build, test, pack, and packed-install smoke flows from a fresh artifact state. The remaining work is narrower and packaging-focused: replace placeholder workspace package metadata, tighten tarball contents, and document the constrained-environment release checklist for the final publish path.

The initializer package is `create-agent-badge`, enabling `npm init agent-badge@latest`, while `agent-badge` is the runtime CLI if the npm name is available at publish time. The intended onboarding is one command that leaves the repository fully configured: README badge inserted once, historical usage backfilled immediately, public Gist created or connected, first badge JSON published, and lightweight refresh installed for future pushes.

The v1 source of truth is the developer machine's local agent directories: `~/.codex/**` and `~/.claude/**`. Scanning must attribute sessions conservatively, prefer cumulative session totals over naive event summing, exclude ambiguous sessions unless the user approves an override, and keep only small derived local state for checkpoints, publish bookkeeping, and attribution overrides.

Publishing follows the standard dynamic-badge model: aggregate totals are normalized into Shields endpoint JSON, written to a public Gist, then rendered through a fixed badge URL embedded in the repository README. After setup, README edits should not be repeated on normal refreshes.

## Constraints

- **Architecture**: Local-first and serverless - collection happens on the developer machine because that is where the source data lives.
- **Privacy**: Aggregate-only publishing - no raw transcripts, prompt text, filenames, or local paths may leave the machine.
- **Distribution**: Initializer-first npm UX - setup must work from `npm init agent-badge@latest` without requiring a global install.
- **GitHub Integration**: Public Gist plus Shields endpoint badge - README badge URLs must remain stable after first insertion.
- **Performance**: Incremental refresh must usually be fast enough for `pre-push` and must default to failure-soft behavior.
- **Reliability**: `init` must be idempotent - re-running setup cannot duplicate README badges, hooks, or Gists.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Use `create-agent-badge` as the initializer package and `agent-badge` as the runtime CLI | Matches npm initializer conventions while keeping the product name clean for normal usage | Implemented in Phase 1 |
| Use local directory scanning as the v1 system of record | It keeps trust high and avoids introducing a second opaque ledger | Implemented in Phases 2-3 for historical backfill and attribution |
| Publish only Shields endpoint JSON through a public Gist | This is the simplest serverless way to render a stable dynamic README badge | Implemented in Phase 4 |
| Insert the README badge once and refresh only the remote JSON afterward | Stable badge URLs avoid repeated README churn and match common badge patterns | Implemented in Phase 4 |
| Use a lightweight `pre-push` hook as the default automation path | It captures normal developer workflow while remaining bypassable with `--no-verify` | Implemented in Phase 1 as a failure-soft managed hook |
| Treat ambiguous historical sessions as opt-in rather than auto-counted | Credibility matters more than inflating totals with weak attribution | Implemented in Phase 3 |
| Persist attribution overrides by stable `provider:providerSessionId` keys | Reuses decisions safely without storing raw cwd or transcript evidence | Implemented in Phase 3 |
| Keep init preflight privacy-safe by reporting normalized provider home labels instead of absolute paths | Prevents local path leakage while still showing actionable provider availability | Implemented in Phase 1 |
| Keep git inspection read-only and perform bootstrap through a separate helper | Preserves non-mutating preflight semantics while still supporting non-git init when allowed | Implemented in Phase 1 |
| Treat v1.1 as release hardening rather than net-new feature expansion | The current gap is production confidence, not missing core capability | Active across Phases 8-10 |
| Use one repo-owned clean-checkout verifier for release-critical validation | Prevents CI/release drift and makes stale artifact failures reproducible locally | Implemented in Phase 8 |
| Clean rebuild verification must clear `*.tsbuildinfo` as well as `dist/` | TypeScript project references can otherwise skip re-emitting deleted runtime artifacts | Implemented in Phase 8 |

## Evolution
